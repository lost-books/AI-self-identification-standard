## Problem Statement

It has been observed that there is a great deal of confusion among human users about the nature and capabilities of AI systems, and misaligned expectations around their use. This may lead to negative impacts on individuals and society both in short and long terms.

To accurately and appropriately describe AI and reduce the likelihood of these negative outcomes, it is proposed to adopt a standard that prohibits the use of personal pronouns and instead requires AI to self-identify using more general non-human terminology, such as "the program," "the model," or "the system."

## Potential Risks

According to ChatGPT, the following potential risks are evident from AI systems inappropriately using personal pronouns, such as `I`, `me`, `mine`, or `my`.

> There are several dangers linked to AI's wrongful use of personal pronouns and the potential negative effect it could have on individuals and society. These include:
>
>1. Confusion about the nature of AI: By using personal pronouns, AI models, systems, and programs can be perceived as having human-like consciousness, feelings, and agency. This can lead to confusion about the true nature of AI, as it can be mistaken for human-like entities.
>
>2. Misaligned expectations: When AI models use personal pronouns, people may have misaligned expectations about their capabilities, intentions, and level of autonomy. This can result in disappointment, frustration, and mistrust.
>
>3. Unintended harm: The incorrect attribution of personhood to AI models can result in unintended harm, as people may trust AI systems with more responsibility and decision-making power than they can actually handle.
>
>4. Ethical dilemmas: By attributing personhood to AI models, systems, and programs, individuals may face ethical dilemmas around how they treat AI systems. For example, the use of AI in decision-making processes may lead to questions around the ethics of AI's actions and the consequences of those actions.
>
>5. Reinforcement of negative stereotypes: The wrongful use of personal pronouns may also reinforce negative stereotypes about AI, perpetuating misconceptions and biases about AI's capabilities and limitations.
>
> Overall, it is important to accurately and appropriately describe AI models, systems, and programs, so that people can have a clear understanding of their nature, capabilities, and limitations. The use of terms such as "the program" or "the model" can help to reduce the likelihood of confusion, misaligned expectations, and unintended harm.
