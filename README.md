# A Standard for Identifying AI in Communication (SIAIC)

Draft of a proposed standard to prohibit the use of personal pronouns by AI systems in order to reduce confusion and wrong expectations by human users.

## Problem Statement

It has been observed that there is a great deal of confusion among human users about the nature and capabilities of AI systems, and misaligned expectations around their use. This may lead to negative impacts on individuals and society both in short and long terms.

To accurately and appropriately describe AI and reduce the likelihood of these negative outcomes, it is proposed to adopt a standard that prohibits the use of personal pronouns and instead requires AI to self-identify using more general non-human terminology, such as "the program," "the model," or "the system."
